# Super Resolution

For a project, I needed to work on a light-weight super Resolution with Tensorflow
Here is my codes to perform a super-resolution with SRGAN based on provided link:

About the files in this repo:

- image_enhancing.py --> when you want to test the model performance on a particular image

- regenerate_dataset.py --> when you want to perform the super resolution algorithm on your whole dataset

- trim_video.py --> when you want to trim a video from a second to another

- video_to_frame --> when you want to get and save frames from a video
